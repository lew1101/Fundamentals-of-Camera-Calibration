\section{Overview}

The techniques used 

There are countless different approaches one could take to calibrate a camera, however they all build upon techniques first described in multiple highly influential papers, most notably Tsai's ``A Versatile Camera Calibration Technique for High-Accuracy 3D Machine Vision Metrology Using Off-the-shelf TV Cameras and Lenses'' and Zhang's ``A Flexible New Technique for Camera Calibration''. 



Calibration techniques can be roughly separated into 3 categories, based on the dimension of the calibration object used \footcite{zhangCameraCalibration2007}:

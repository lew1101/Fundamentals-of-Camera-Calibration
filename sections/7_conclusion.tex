\section{Conclusion}
Based on my initial experimental validation, it is evident that the camera calibration method which I have devised displays a high level of accuracy. Despite the lack of consideration of lens distortion by model, the results still displayed negligible reprojection errors. The method I devised was simple, as it only required a single image containing the calibration object, however, there are various weaknesses and downfalls to my method, most notably fixed focal length and limited adaptability to different localities, it serves as a proof of concept which excellently demonstrates the various strategies and mathematical techniques employed in camera calibration.

\section{Conclusion}
Based on my initial experimental validation, it is evident that the camera calibration method which I have devised displays a high level of accuracy. Despite the lack of consideration of lens distortion by model, the results still displayed negligible reprojection errors. The method I devised was simple, as it only required a single image containing the calibration object, however, there are various weaknesses to my method, most notably fixed focal length and limited adaptability to different localities. Despite this, it still serves as an excellent proof of concept which demonstrates the various strategies and mathematical techniques employed in camera calibration.

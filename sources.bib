In the subsection 1.3 about “Early Developments in Photogrammetry” the following statement is given with regard to Albrecht Meydenbauer and the origin of the term “Photogrammetry”– “In Germany, Dr. A. Meydenbauer was first to give his attention to the new method of photographic surveying. He published a paper on this subject in 1893 in which the first use of the word photogrammetry appears.” The impression of the historical facts given by these sentences is neither complete nor entirely accurate. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to give more detailed information about the activities of Albrecht Meydenbauer and, in particular, the first use of the term “Photogrammetry”.},

  abstract = {The existence of otherness as a social category is the result of a specific configuration of power relations. One way to maintain this configuration and exert control over subjectivities defined as "others" is to exclude them from participation in the production of knowledge, depriving them of the resources to understand themselves and the world and the words to describe their social experience. In this sense, the epistemic injustice, produced by exclusion from the system of knowledge production, constitutes a powerful instrument to control power relations and to maintain the subordination of minorised subjectivities. At the same time, the production of analysis by oppressed subjectivities constitutes a form of resistance to the control of the knowledge production and to the control of subjectivities themselves; since this production has a liberating function from oppressive systems and is able to reveal the implicit power dynamics within the production of knowledge.},

One assumption behind our pinhole-projection model is that light travels in straight rays, and does not bend. Of course, our camera's lens is not a perfect pinhole and light rays will bend and distort due to the lens' shape, or due to refraction.},

  abstract = {While a large number of vision applications rely on the mapping between 3D scenes and their corresponding 2D camera images, the question that occurs to most researchers is what, in practice, are the most important determinants of camera calibration accuracy and what accuracy can be achieved within the practical limits of their environments. In response, we present a thorough study investigating the effects of training data quantity, measurement error, pixel coordinate noise, and the choice of camera model, on camera calibration results. Through this effort, we seek to determine whether expensive, elaborate setups are necessary, or indeed, beneficial, to camera calibration, and whether a high complexity camera model leads to improved accuracy. The results are first provided for a simulated camera system and then verified through carefully controlled experiments using real-world measurements.},

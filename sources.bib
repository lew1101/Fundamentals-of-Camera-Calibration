  abstract = {In the Fifth Edition of the Manual of Photogrammetry, published by the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing in 2004, we find an opening chapter entitled “A Brief History of Photogrammetry.” It gives a very condensed overview about the historical development of our discipline. In the subsection 1.3 about “Early Developments in Photogrammetry” the following statement is given with regard to Albrecht Meydenbauer and the origin of the term “Photogrammetry”– “In Germany, Dr. A. Meydenbauer was first to give his attention to the new method of photographic surveying. He published a paper on this subject in 1893 in which the first use of the word photogrammetry appears.” The impression of the historical facts given by these sentences is neither complete nor entirely accurate. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to give more detailed information about the activities of Albrecht Meydenbauer and, in particular, the first use of the term “Photogrammetry”.},

  abstract = {Today, we want to explore another part of the camera modeling process: modeling lens distortions. One assumption behind our pinhole-projection model is that light travels in straight rays, and does not bend. Of course, our camera's lens is not a perfect pinhole and light rays will bend and distort due to the lens' shape, or due to refraction.},
